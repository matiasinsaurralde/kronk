### 1.1 What is Kronk

Kronk is a Go SDK and Model Server for running local inference with open-source
models. It's built on top of two best-in-class C++ inference engines (llama.cpp
and whisper.cpp).

- **llama.cpp** — for GGUF text, vision, embedding, and reranking models.
- **whisper.cpp** — for GGML speech-to-text models, exposed through Kronk's
  **Bucky** subsystem. See [Chapter 18: Bucky (Audio Transcription)](chapter-18-bucky.md).

Together these give Kronk hardware-accelerated inference for text generation,
vision, audio transcription, embeddings, and reranking — all from a single Go
process, with no Python and no CGO build chain. Kronk is being designed to be
your personal engine for running open source models locally.

**The SDK is the foundation.**

The Kronk Model Server is built entirely on top of the SDK — we "dog food" our
own library. Everything the model server can do is available to you as a SDK
developer to help you write your own applications.

**You don't need a model server.**

The real power of Kronk is that you can embed
model inference directly into your Go applications. Load models, run inference,
manage caching, and handle concurrent requests — all without running the models
in a separate server process. The [examples](sdk/examples) directory demonstrates
building standalone applications with the SDK.

**The Model Server is optional.**

When you do need an model server (for web UIs,
multi-client access, or OpenAI-compatible endpoints), the Kronk Model Server
provides:

- OpenAI and Anthropic compatible REST APIs
- OpenWebUI integration
- Agent and tool support for local models
- Any OpenAI-compatible client

### 1.2 Key Features

**Model Types**

- **Text Generation** - Chat completions and streaming responses with reasoning support.
- **Vision** - Image understanding and analysis.
- **Audio** - Speech-to-text transcription via the **Bucky** subsystem (whisper.cpp). See [Chapter 18: Bucky (Audio Transcription)](chapter-18-bucky.md).
- **Embeddings** - Vector embeddings for semantic search and RAG.
- **Reranking** - Document relevance scoring.

**Performance**

- **Batch Processing** - Process multiple requests concurrently within a set of partitioned KV cache sequences.
- **Message Caching** - System prompt and incremental message caching to reduce redundant computation.
- **YaRN Context Extension** - Extend context windows 2-4x beyond native training length.
- **Model Pooling** - Keep a number of models loaded in memory with configurable TTL.

**Operations**

- **Catalog System** - Your personal catalog of downloaded models, seeded with a starter list and managed via the CLI and BUI.
- **Browser UI (BUI)** - Web interface for model management, downloads, and configuration.
- **Authentication** - JWT-based security with key management, endpoint authorization and rate limiting.
- **Observability** - Tracing and metrics integration with Grafana support.
- **Local Storage** - Everything Kronk manages — catalog, downloaded models, llama.cpp libraries, and per-model configuration — lives under `~/.kronk/`.

### 1.3 Supported Platforms and Hardware

Kronk supports full hardware acceleration across major platforms:

| **OS**  | **CPU**      | **GPU**                         |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Linux   | amd64, arm64 | CUDA, Vulkan, HIP, ROCm, SYCL   |
| macOS   | arm64        | Metal                           |
| Windows | amd64        | CUDA, Vulkan, HIP, SYCL, OpenCL |

**Hardware Requirements**

- Minimum 8GB RAM for small models (1-3B parameters)
- 16GB+ RAM recommended for medium models (7-8B parameters)
- 32GB+ RAM or dedicated GPU VRAM for large models (30B+ parameters)
- GPU with Metal, CUDA, or Vulkan support recommended for optimal performance

### 1.4 Architecture Overview

Kronk is designed as a layered architecture where the SDK provides all core
functionality and the Model Server is one application built on top of it.

**Layer Breakdown:**

| Layer           | Component                         | Purpose                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Application** | Kronk Model Server                | REST API server (or your own app)          |
| **SDK Tools**   | Models, Libs, Downloader, Devices | High-level APIs for common tasks           |
| **SDK Core**    | Kronk SDK API, Model SDK API      | Model loading, inference, pooling, caching |
| **Bindings**    | yzma (non-CGO FFI via purego)     | Go bindings to llama.cpp without CGO       |
| **Engine**      | llama.cpp                         | Hardware-accelerated inference             |
| **Hardware**    | Metal, CUDA, Vulkan, CPU          | GPU/CPU acceleration                       |

Your application sits at the same level as the Kronk Model Server. You have access
to the exact same SDK APIs. Whether you're building a CLI tool, a web service,
an embedded system, or a desktop app — you get the full power of local model
inference without any server overhead.

**SDK vs Server Usage:**

```go
// Direct SDK usage - no server needed
cfg := model.Config{
    ModelFiles: modelPath.ModelFiles,
    CacheTypeK: model.GGMLTypeQ8_0,
    CacheTypeV: model.GGMLTypeQ8_0,
}

krn, _ := kronk.New(cfg)
defer krn.Unload(ctx)

ch, _ := krn.ChatStreaming(ctx, model.D{
    "messages":   model.DocumentArray(model.TextMessage(model.RoleUser, "Hello")),
    "max_tokens": 2048,
})

for resp := range ch {
    fmt.Print(resp.Choice[0].Delta.Content)
}
```

```shell
# Or use the Model Server for OpenAI-compatible API.
# Server-side per-model tuning lives in ~/.kronk/model_config.yaml.
kronk server start
curl http://localhost:11435/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0","messages":[...]}'
```

### 1.5 Getting Started

Kronk is your personal engine for running open source models locally. Find
your hardware below, copy the one command, and run it. Then open
http://localhost:11435 in your browser to download a model and start
chatting.

#### 1.5.1 Quick Start — Copy, Paste, Run

**🍎 On a Mac (MacBook, Mac mini, Mac Studio, iMac)**

Installs Kronk as a normal app and uses your Mac's GPU automatically. Paste
this into the Terminal app:

```shell
brew tap ardanlabs/kronk && brew trust ardanlabs/kronk && brew install kronk
KRONK_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED=true kronk server start
```

**🟩 If you have an NVIDIA graphics card (Linux or Windows)**

Runs in Docker with GPU acceleration. Needs Docker + the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html):

```shell
docker run -d --name kronk --restart unless-stopped --runtime=nvidia --gpus all \
  -e KRONK_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED=true \
  -p 11435:11435 -v kronk-data:/kronk \
  ghcr.io/ardanlabs/kronk:latest-cuda
```

**🖥️ If you have an AMD graphics card (Linux)**

Runs in Docker using ROCm. Needs Docker and access to `/dev/kfd` and
`/dev/dri`:

```shell
docker run -d --name kronk --restart unless-stopped \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video --group-add render \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  -e KRONK_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED=true \
  -p 11435:11435 -v kronk-data:/kronk \
  ghcr.io/ardanlabs/kronk:latest-rocm
```

**🤷 Not sure, or none of the above**

This runs on any computer with Docker, using just the CPU. It works
everywhere, but don't expect great performance — larger models will be slow:

```shell
docker run -d --name kronk --restart unless-stopped \
  -e KRONK_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED=true \
  -p 11435:11435 -v kronk-data:/kronk \
  ghcr.io/ardanlabs/kronk:latest
```

**Now open http://localhost:11435** in your browser. Go to **Catalog**,
download a small model to try (e.g. `Qwopus3.5-4B-Coder.Q8_0`), then open
**Chat** and ask it something. That's it — Kronk is running locally, at zero
per-token cost, and nothing you type leaves your machine.

> **Heads up:** the Docker commands above publish port `11435` on every
> network interface with no authentication and downloads enabled — fine on
> your own machine, but if the host is reachable by anyone else (a cloud VM,
> a shared network), turn on auth and lock down the port first. See
> [Going to Production](#153-going-to-production) below.

#### 1.5.2 Which One Should I Use?

The quick start above already picked for you, but here's the difference in
plain terms:

- **Standalone app** (the Mac command) — Kronk installed like any normal
  program. Best for your own laptop or desktop. Full details in
  [2.3 Installing the CLI](chapter-02-installation.md#23-installing-the-cli).
- **Docker container** (the graphics-card and CPU commands) — Kronk runs from
  a ready-made image, nothing to install but Docker itself. Best for a server
  or remote machine that should keep running on its own. Full details in
  [2.4 Docker / OCI Container](chapter-02-installation.md#24-docker--oci-container).

#### 1.5.3 Going to Production

Before you expose Kronk beyond your own machine, turn on authentication:
enable it, retrieve the admin token, and mint scoped user tokens. See
[Chapter 12: Security & Authentication](chapter-12-security-authentication.md).
For unattended remote hosts,
[Chapter 2.4: Docker / OCI Container](chapter-02-installation.md#24-docker--oci-container)
covers running headless with auto-restart, updates, and uninstalling.
